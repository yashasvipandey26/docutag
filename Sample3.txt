Independent India
• The country has experienced an increase in per capita income,
especially since the 1980s, as well as reductions in poverty and infant
mortality rates.
• These improvements are not insignificant and mark a sharp break from
the near stagnation that the country experienced during British rule.
• But a comparison with the later superior performance of China and
South Korea, countries with a comparable level of development in the

1950s, reveals that India’s performance remains below its potential.

Independent India
• When India became a republic in 1950, the economy was primarily
agrarian, with three- fifths of output originating from agriculture.
• In the seventy years since independence, there has been a significant
transformation of economic activity away from agriculture, with less than
one-fifth of output now originating from agriculture and the rest from
manufacturing and services.
• Since the 1980s, along with structural change, there has been strong
economic growth, and the middle class has been expanding
• This resulted into massive social transformation in Indian society resulting
into massive industrialisation, urbanisation, and the rise of India as a global
economic player
• New economic reforms of 1991 usher in private investment and economic
growth was phenomenal till 2010, followed by a period of declining growth.

Independent India
• Poverty and massive deindustrialisation due to colonial rule
• Less than a sixth of Indians were literate (Female literacy was
8.8%)
• Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) of 2000 for every 100,000 live
births and an Infant Mortality Rate (IFR) of 150

• Life expectancy was 32 years
Huge dependence on agriculture
• Agriculture was the first considered source of income and
occupation with over 72.7 percent of the working population
employed, if not dependent in agriculture and allied activitiesq
• Backward Economy
• Crucial role of the state

• National consensus on planning

Independent India: The Initial Strategy
• The government in the 1950s adopted a very particular strategy of
economic development: rapid industrialization by implementing

centrally prepared five-year plans that involved raising a
massive amount of resources and investing them in the
creation of large industrial state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

• The industries chosen were those producing basic and heavy industrial
goods such as steel, chemicals, machines and tools, locomotives,
and power.
• Industrialization was pursued because leaders believed, based in
part on the beliefs of some economists, that the industrial sector offers
the greatest scope of growth in production.

Independent India: The Initial Strategy
“To import from abroad is to be slaves of foreign countries,” the first Prime
Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

• Investments in the creation of public enterprises were chosen because
one goal of the government was to establish a “socialistic pattern of
society,” i.e., using democratic methods to bring large swathes of the
country’s productive resources under public ownership.
•

Industries producing basic and heavy goods were chosen for
investment over consumer goods because the government wanted to
reduce the country’s reliance on imports of basic and heavy industrial
goods in line with their belief in the goodness of national self-reliance.

Indepedent India: Policies
• Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI)
• That advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic

production
• A country should attempt to reduce its foreign dependency
through the local production of industralised products
• A focus on self-sufficiency to avoid dependence on imports, and
hence excessive external influence on domestic affairs.

• It translated into an emphasis on rapid industrialization,
especially the creation of domestic heavy industries—that is,
industries producing capital goods

Indepedent India: Policies
• Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI)
• This view was understandable in a country emerging from
colonialism, and which saw itself as an exemplar for other
developing countries.
• Widely followed and practised in newly independent countries in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America

Economic Policies: interventionist model
• The economic policy of a nation is crucial in understanding its
economic foundation
• Centralised Planning:

• Top-down approach with the state (government) a playing a
pivotal role in the planning and execution of development
• Central government set the priorities, objectives, and targets
• Minimal involvement of private players

• Public Sector:
• Help achieve balanced regional development in our vast and
diverse country
• Serve social objectives, not merely the goal of profitability
• Serve the strategic needs of the country

Indepedent India
• India set up the Planning Commission in 1950 to oversee the entire
range of planning, including resource allocation, implementation and
appraisal of five-year plans.

• The five-year plans were centralized economic and social growth
programmes modelled after those prevalent in the USSR. India’s first
five-year plan, launched in 1951, focused on agriculture and irrigation
to boost farm output as India was losing precious foreign reserves on
foodgrain imports.
• The motto of the first five year plans was ‘Development of
agriculture’

• It was based on the Harrod-Domar model that sought to boost
economic growth through higher savings and investments. The plan
was a success, with the economy growing at an annualized 3.6%,
beating the target of 2.1%.

The swadeshi spirit
• The second five-year plan (1956-61) laid the foundation for economic
modernization to better serve India’s long-term growth imperatives
• Launched in 1956, it was based on the Mahalanobis model that
advocated rapid industrialization with a focus on heavy industries and
capital goods
• Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was perhaps the single most
important individual in directing Indian development planning.
• He was the chief adviser to the commission from 1955, founded
the Indian Statistical Institute, and is considered the father of
modern statistics in India
• The Mahalanobis plan was, in a way, an invocation of the spirit of
swadeshi or self-reliance

The swadeshi spirit
• The second five-year Plan and the Industrial Policy Resolution 1956
(long considered the economic constitution of India) paved the way
for the development of the public sector and ushered in the licence
Raj
• The resolution set out as national objective the establishment of a
socialist pattern of society. It also categorized industries into three
groups:
1. Industries of basic and strategic importance were to be
exclusively in the public sector
2. The second group comprised industries that were to be
incrementally state-owned
3. The third, comprising mostly consumer industries, was left
for the private sector. The private sector, however, was kept
on a tight leash through a system of licences

Rapid Industrialsation
•

In the second plan, there was a quest to quickly industrialize, which had caused a large
reallocation of funds away from the farm sector. Agriculture outlay was nearly halved to 14%
in the second Plan.

• ‘Temples of Modern India’
•

Nehru identified power and steel as the key bases for planning. He described the 680ft
Bhakra multi-purpose project on the Sutlej river in Himachal Pradesh as the new temple
of a resurgent India.

•

The politicies of big dams aside, the huge Bhakra-Nangal dams are among several hydel
projects India built to light up homes, run factories, and irrigate crops.

•

The second plan set a target to produce 6 million tonnes of steel. Germany was
contracted to build a steel plant in Rourkela, while Russia and Britain would build one
each in Bhilai and Durgapur, respectively.

•

The Indian Institutes of Technology and the Atomic Energy Commission were the other
“modern temples".

Structural change
•

There has been significant change in the structure of the Indian economy in the six

decades since independence:
•

Whereas in 1955, agriculture comprised 57 per cent of output, in 2021, it
comprised a mere 15 per cent.

•

While in 1955, manufacturing comprised 9.9 per cent of output, in 2021, it was 18
per cent. This was mostly due to the growth in the output of the organised or
formal manufacturing sector, from 4.9 per cent in 1955 to 11.2 per cent in 2012. P

•

erhaps the most remarkable feature of the Indian economy’s structural change has
been the increase in the share of the service sector—from 19 per cent of GDP in
1955 to 54 per cent in 2021.

•

It is well known that India’s pattern of economic development has been atypical,
in that the service sector has comprised a far higher share of economic activity
than should have been the case, given India’s level of per capita income

testable components: the cause-and-effect relationships that can be
examined, the concepts that should be operationalized, and the
variables that are relevant to control.
A good theory, in this approach, typically builds on previous work. A
study adds new knowledge

There is a linear progression that needs to be followed: from theory, to
hypothesis development, to data collection, to interpretation of findings, to
the refinement of theory or the generation of new causal explanations.
The objectivist deductive researcher begins by identifying the theory from
which to build the study’s theoretical framework
